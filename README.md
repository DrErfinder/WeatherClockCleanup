# Weather Clock 🌦️🕐
You have no idea what's the weather? With this Datapack a clock will tell you.

## How it works
* If select a clock in your hotbar, the current weather is displayed on screen.
* If you put a clock in an item frame, the current weather will be displayed if you look at it.

## Other Features
* Minimal impact on performance: Most commands are only executed on demand or every 5 seconds  
* Please note that due to this 👆 and how minecraft weather works it might take a few seconnds to update item frames.

## Installation ✔️
Download the latest release from the releases Section on Github or from Planet Minecraft and place the file `WeatherClock.zip` in your datapacks folder.

## Uninstallation ❌
Run the command `/function weather_clock:uninstall` and delete the `AlwaysThunder.zip` from your datapacks folder.  
If you had any clocks in item frames in unloaded chunks, the name (Sunny, Rain or Thunder) will stay on the clock (The clock will still works as normal 😉).  
In case you don't want that you can install this Datapack: (Also realy usefull for Servers)
